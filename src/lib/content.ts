We wish to emphasise that there can be no conversation about personal laws without talking about queer and trans lived realities. Since the 21st Law Commission in 2018, the year Section 377 was read down by the Supreme Court, what has changed is that queer and trans lived realities and relationships have become recognized and become part of the debates on marriage and families.',

                'In 2018, the 21st Law Commission issued a Consultation Paper on Reform of Family Law, in which it argued unequivocally that a UCC was ‘neither necessary nor desirable at this stage.’ The Commission also drew attention to the various aspects mentioned above that need to be addressed before taking any steps further. Queer trans families or living arrangements and their rights vis a vis their natal families, however, did not get addressed there apart from a footnote on page 34, that states:',

The broader definitions of ‘man‘ and ‘woman‘ that the law now presumes, should now imply that matrimonial rights must also be accessible to all persons inhabiting these legal definitions. We urge deeper consultation with the LGBTQI communities to take this conversation forward.”',
                'After the consultation paper of the 21st Law Commission, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act was enacted in 2019. This has severe implications for family law whose whole conception is not only within the binary but also in a limited imagination of a patrilineal, patrilocal, patriarchal family for the most part.',

                '##We write to express our grave concern regarding the public notice issued by the LCI soliciting views and ideas of the “public at large and recognised religious organisations on the UCC.” Our concerns are as follows:$$',
                'a. ##Ironically, despite the call of the LCI inviting ‘views’ from the public, there is complete lack of information about$$ (i) what would actually constitute this Uniform Civil Code (ii) how it would conceive of “uniformity” in matters of marriage, divorce, custody, adoption, maintenance, inheritance, etc across diverse communities, historico-geographic locations, and irrespective of marital status, and (iii) how the LCI envisions its implementation.',
                'b. ##In the absence of any concrete proposal, outline or framework or adequate time for the public to respond, what should have been a serious public engagement, has been reduced to an opaque process marked by political rhetoric and social media campaigns.$$ Vested interests, ranging from temple associations to Resident Welfare Associations, and others ##are spreading a highly communalised campaign in favour of the idea of a UCC that specifically targets religious minority communities$$. Given the track record of the BJP-led government in power, serious apprehensions are being expressed by religious minority groups, tribal and Adivasi communities across the country about the intent and remit of the proposed exercise. It is extremely disappointing that the LCI, the foremost statutory body for legal deliberation in India, with an almost 200 year old history of law reform, has issued this notice in such a casual and cavalier manner. Initiating an ill-informed and undemocratic process on an issue that is complex, sensitive, and that has been contested for decades.',
                '##It is even more worrisome that the current LCI has raised this topic without any substantial reference to the 21st LCI report of 2018 on the very same issue.$$ In its Consultation Paper on “Reforms of Family Law,” the 21st LCI made several recommendations on the matter of gender equality and concluded that, “Uniform Civil Code is neither necessary nor desirable at this stage as it would be counter-productive for the harmony of the nation,” and suggested that “reforms in personal laws should be done by amendments and not by replacement.” Further, by identifying that “discrimination and not difference that lies at the root of inequality the 21st LCI had prioritised ‘gender equality within each religious community, rather than between communities.”',
                '##Therefore, the current notice dated 14/06/2023 that simply states the 22nd LCI ‘considered it expedient to deliberate afresh’ without clarifying what warrants a rethink, betrays a complete lack of seriousness on a matter that impacts the life of many, particularly women.$$ It only carries a vague reference to ‘various court orders’, without even bothering to specify which court orders and what issues they raise. In the absence of clear terms of reference, it appears that the present endeavour is more of a ‘political exercise’ than a ‘legal’ one.',
                'c. ##It is deeply troubling that the LCI has specifically sought “views from the public at large and recognised religious organisations” to the UCC.$$ This reveals the erroneous presumption that the Indian people can be divided en masse only into religious groupings; and that these groupings can only be represented by religious leaders and so called “recognised religious organisations.” Consequently, the notice fails to recognise or acknowledge that the primary members who are impacted by such laws are women from across religious, caste, Adivasi, and tribal communities, gender minorities, atheists, and agnostics. Hence such a call only serves to reinforce the patriarchal belief that they are not the primary stakeholders in gender-just family law reforms - which makes this a deeply discriminatory process. Pertinently, the term “recognised religious organisations” finds no reference in the Constitution or any other statute, that governs the secular constitutional Republic of India.',
                '##Amplifying the confusion surrounding the UCC have been contradictory and conflicting public declarations by the government.$$ In Bhopal on 2 July 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that India needed a UCC as the country could not run with the dual system of “separate laws for separate communities.” Then on 7 July, 2023, Home Minister Amit Shah assured the Chief Minister of Nagaland that, “the government is actively considering exempting Christians and certain tribal areas from the proposed Uniform Civil Code (UCC).” The Chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Law and Justice, Sushil K Modi has also stated that the exemption would extend to states under Article 371 such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh. ##If that is so, what parts of the nation and which communities is the proposed UCC meant to bring ‘uniformity’ to?

                    'Further, the Central Government in the marriage equality matter before the Supreme Court also asserted that marriage is a religious institution and despite codification of personal laws, it is a “sacrament” and thus, the “sanctity” of personal laws must not be interfered with.',

                'd. ##On the matter of ending unequal rights/discrimination against women, the present government’s stance continues to be selective, problematic and lacking credibility.$$ Take for instance the much-discussed issue of polygamy among Muslim communities, around which much of the current propaganda around UCC is centred. The National Family Health Survey - 5 (2019-20) reveals the prevalence of polygamy is 2.1% among Christians, 1.9% among Muslims, 1.3% among Hindus, and 1.6% among other religious groups. Yet, the focus remains on prohibiting polygamy within Muslim communities, without any apparent intent to secure the rights of women in such bi- or polygamous marriages across communities. Therefore we question whether the government is propounding the UCC to ensure justice for all women, or use this as an occasion to target one community as being discriminatory to women, even though data reveals a different reality.',
